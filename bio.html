<p> With that photo its me at a skatepark in the dead of night during the winter time in chicago. It was sa good like 10 or so maybe degrees and i had the bright idea of taking some photos at night in the skate park, See what i didnt think of or remember was how long it would take to get certain shots or even get the right angles with the streets lights and ways to face so the wind wouldnt knock me over.. I was out there for about and hour or so i couldnt feel my hands at the end of it but hey they turned out pretty good and im glad they did but the lore behind that photo will always be in the back of my mind to never do it again.</p>
