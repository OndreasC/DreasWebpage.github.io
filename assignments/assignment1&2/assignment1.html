<p>When I first began reading the article I thougth it was gonna be telling me about how the author got started with using the internet. Which it did but I also was not expecting it take to the turn to show how it also got very salty and a little toxic. Like how it started off being somehting new and creative for people to get on and enjoy looking at cool things on the internet to it falling in the hands of highschoolers and taking a turn with social media wars between facebook and myspace or even how vapor wave a very popular thing now came to be back in the early 2010. ‚Äúmyspace, began to view facebook as a cleaner, less seedy alternative for their children.‚Äù It also stated with white teens telling interviewers and other highschool students that my space was ghetto and was only being used for less fortunate people. Although the purge of myspace and most of its content and users did not help either it gave people back then more reason to convert to facebook. There are even some counts of people being very very upset about their myspace account being randomly deleted which is fair and understandbale.</p>
<p>The revenge of the old internet segment of the article was also nice with it talking about the slow death of facebook for doing what myspace did back then and that‚Äôs control your data so that everything you see really isnt in your control. With just your search bar being a small influence on what you see the apps goal is to keep you on the app scrolling and looking at your phone for as long as possible. The stats of the app with ages between 18-29 unistalling the app more frequently leaving the older generation to run the app will surely lead to its demise behind its lost and old competitor mypsace. On the topic of vapor wave I am surprised that it has lasted as long as it has due to the fact I still see vaporwave wallpapers and everything on computers and phones. It‚Äôs a trend that‚Äôs found its way through the decades and has not died out like other trends like dances or clothing styles you know?</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmazing isnt it how Jameson wwriting in 1991, predicted the presence of windows 95 gifs in my instagram story?‚Äù. This also shows us how people always knew there would be more advances in the internet and I have to say Im glad there was. With the current state of the internet it could either be really good for you or really bad and that goes for a lot of things in terms of career or even social media status if you somehow climb you way up the ranks. It‚Äôs a state of being scared to make the wrong decision in the face of the internt one post can change anything. Even the wrong words can be turned into something worse. But it also give gateway to new communication efforts or even allowing people to send messages in mere seconds across the world. With everything the internets been through its one of those love and hate kind of things because either you do really well on it. Or maybe youre a menace on here maybe your just an average person looking at memes on the internet like me. A college student writing a 600 word response for a week 1 grade on the internt while using the internet. With this coming to an end its given me some more insight on how things really got started with the internet and I found the article really interesting. The read felt pretty short but maybe that was because I was enjoying it all around.</p>
