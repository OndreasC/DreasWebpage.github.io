	<p> With rick and morty the seasons are vast and many with season 7 just now coming out and season 8 already been said to be coming out in the next year! The show is still going on strong with new adventures and characters for you to meet and love.</p>
	<p> For the rankings of the seasons it all starts with season 3 being one of the best of the ranking in my opinion if you were to asking me. With season 4 being in close second to that and then ending off with season 2 being the 3rd best overall season of the show you cant go wrong with either one when it comes to picking one to binge watch over or have it on as white noise.</p>
	<p> and with season 7 being the latest season its good to know that there are many more the show will carry you on a crazy loop of adventures and mischeif through the cosmos. With the 80 year old blue haired mad scientist and his pubscent teenage grandson going on some of the most head turning adventures youve seen in a while.
